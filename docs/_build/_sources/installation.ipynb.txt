    "`hs_process` is an open-source package written in Python. It should run on all major platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, Mac), but it was developed on Windows 10 and limited testing has been performed on Linux and Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Python\n",
    "There are many ways to download and install Python. As a scientist, my recommendation is definitely through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Anaconda will have the more popular packages already installed in your Python environment, and it comes with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Spyder and Jupyter make working with Python quite easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I hope you'll find `hs_process` rather straightforward, it will probably be tricky if you have limited coding experience, particularly in the Python language. You may find it to your benefit to have a Python refresher before using `hs_proces`. If you're a beginner, it will be helpful to read the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and/or get some hands-on practice with [this Python Tutorial by w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).\n",

    "\n",
    "\tpip install hs_process\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the development version directly from github:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install git+https://github.com/tnigon/hs_process\n",
