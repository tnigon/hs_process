Ideally, the list of packages in a given environment should only include those required in the project we are working on, not all packages that have ever been installed and are needed for any project you've ever worked on (this can be dozens or even hundreds of packages). A downside with too many packages is that it is inefficient to share your environment with someone else that would like to use the program.
