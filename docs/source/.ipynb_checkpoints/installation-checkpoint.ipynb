    "There are many ways to download and install Python. The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) is recommended becuase it can simplify the installation of package dependencies and streamlines the process of setting up the virtual environment. Anaconda also comes with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), each of which make working with Python quite easy.\n",

    "## Python environment setup and dependencies\n",
    "A *Python environment* refers to the ecosystem consisting of a particular installed version of [Python](https://www.python.org/), as well as any third-party packages it has access to. In Python, every time a package is installed (e.g., `pip install some_third_party_package`, `conda install -c conda-forge some_third_party_package`, etc.), your Python environment is gaining functionality that builds upon the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is great because the possibilities of what can be accomplished using Python is virtually limitless. Ideally, the list of packages in a given environment should only include those required in the project we are working on, not all packages that have ever been installed and are needed for any project you've ever worked on (this can be dozens or even hundreds of packages). A downside with too many packages is that it is inefficient to share your environment with someone else that would like to use the program. As time goes on, there may also be compatibility issues among package dependencies and your code that can be avoided by creating a tidy little Python environment for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to go about setting up a new environment and getting the dependencies installed. In this tutorial, there are several installation options provided with instructions. Please choose one of the three options.\n",
